            <h2>About Whitney Houston's Summary Page</h2>
            <p>Born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey, Houston almost seemed destined from birth to become a singer. 
               Her mother and cousin were both legendary figures in American gospel, soul and pop music. Cissy Houston was 
               the choir minister at New Hope Baptist Church, and it was there that a young Houston got her start. Even as a
               child, Houston was able to wow audiences; she later told Diane Sawyer that a rapturous response from the 
               congregation at New Hope had a powerful effect upon her: "I think I knew then that [my singing ability] was an
               infectious thing that God had given me."</p>
               <img id="main_img_resize" src="images/Whitney_Houston1.jpg" alt="Collection of hits">

            <p> When she was 19, Houston was discovered in a nightclub by Arista Records' Clive Davis, who signed her 
                immediately and took the helm of her career as she navigated from gospel to pop stardom. In 1983, Houston 
                made her debut on national television, appearing on The Merv Griffin Show to sing "Home" from the musical The Wiz.
                She and Davis spent the next two years working on her debut album, finding the best producers and songwriters 
                available to showcase her amazing vocal talent.</p>

            <h4>Greatest Hits</h4>
            <p>Whitney: The Greatest Hits is a compilation album by American singer Whitney Houston, released in May 2000. The set consists
               of disc one with ballads and disc two with uptempo numbers and remixes, spanning the first 15 years of Houston's music career.
               Houston's performance of "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Super Bowl XXV, and 1988 Olympics tribute "One Moment in Time" are also
               included in the set. The collection includes four new songs—"Could I Have This Kiss Forever", duet with Enrique Iglesias, "If I 
               Told You That", duet with George Michael, "Same Script, Different Cast", duet with Deborah Cox and "Fine"—all of which were released 
               as singles. It also includes three other songs that had never appeared on a Houston album: "One Moment in Time", "The Star Spangled Banner",
               and "If You Say My Eyes Are Beautiful", a duet with Jermaine Jackson from his 1986 Precious Moments album. Along with the album, an 
               accompanying VHS and DVD was released featuring the music videos to Houston's greatest hits, as well as several hard-to-find live performances
               including her 1983 debut on The Merv Griffin Show, and interviews.</p>

        <h4>Best Album</h4>
        <p>Houston's compilation album had been in development for several years prior to its release. As early as 1995, Billboard listed Houston's Greatest Hits
           album as an upcoming release scheduled for October of that year. Billboard magazine mentioned a "long-promised" Greatest Hits collection again in July
           1996, this time due that autumn. Speculation on the timing of the release continued into 1997, with Houston quoted that year as saying: "Oh, Clive is 
           on my case about this greatest hits album. He's like, Whitney, we have to do a greatest hits album, I mean you're far long overdue."</p>

        <h4>Whitney's Death</h4>
        <p>On February 11 2012, Houston was found unconscious in Suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton, submerged in the bathtub. Beverly 
           Hills paramedics arrived about 3:30 pm, found Houston unresponsive, and performed CPR. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 pm PST. 
           The cause of death was not immediately known; local police said there were "no obvious signs of criminal intent". On March 22, 2012, 
           the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office reported that Houston's death was caused by drowning and the "effects of atherosclerotic heart 
           disease and cocaine use". The office said the amount of cocaine found in Houston's body indicated that she used the substance shortly
           before her death. </p>
