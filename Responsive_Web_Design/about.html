            <h2>About Whitney Houston's Summary Page</h2>
            <p>Born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey, Houston almost seemed destined from birth to become a singer. 
               Her mother and cousin were both legendary figures in American gospel, soul and pop music. Cissy Houston was 
               the choir minister at New Hope Baptist Church, and it was there that a young Houston got her start. Even as a
               child, Houston was able to wow audiences; she later told Diane Sawyer that a rapturous response from the 
               congregation at New Hope had a powerful effect upon her: "I think I knew then that [my singing ability] was an
               infectious thing that God had given me."</p>

            <p> When she was 19, Houston was discovered in a nightclub by Arista Records' Clive Davis, who signed her 
                immediately and took the helm of her career as she navigated from gospel to pop stardom. In 1983, Houston 
                made her debut on national television, appearing on The Merv Griffin Show to sing "Home" from the musical The Wiz.
                She and Davis spent the next two years working on her debut album, finding the best producers and songwriters 
                available to showcase her amazing vocal talent.</p>

        <h4>Whitney's Death</h4>
        <p>On February 11 2012, Houston was found unconscious in Suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton, submerged in the bathtub. Beverly 
           Hills paramedics arrived about 3:30 pm, found Houston unresponsive, and performed CPR. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 pm PST. 
           The cause of death was not immediately known; local police said there were "no obvious signs of criminal intent". On March 22, 2012, 
           the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office reported that Houston's death was caused by drowning and the "effects of atherosclerotic heart 
           disease and cocaine use". The office said the amount of cocaine found in Houston's body indicated that she used the substance shortly
           before her death. </p>
