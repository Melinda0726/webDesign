        <h4>Whitney's Death</h4>
        <p>On February 11 2012, Houston was found unconscious in Suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton, submerged in the bathtub. Beverly 
           Hills paramedics arrived about 3:30 pm, found Houston unresponsive, and performed CPR. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 pm PST. 
           The cause of death was not immediately known; local police said there were "no obvious signs of criminal intent". On March 22, 2012, 
           the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office reported that Houston's death was caused by drowning and the "effects of atherosclerotic heart 
           disease and cocaine use". The office said the amount of cocaine found in Houston's body indicated that she used the substance shortly
           before her death. </p>
