            <h2>Welcome to Whitney Houston's Summary Page</h2>
            <p>Whitney Houston has been regarded as one of the greatest vocalists of all time and a cultural icon. 
               She is also recognized as one of the most influential R&B artists in history.
               During the 1980s, MTV was coming into its own and received criticism for not playing enough 
               videos by black artists. With Michael Jackson breaking down the color barrier for black men, 
               Houston did the same for black women. She became the first black woman to receive heavy rotation 
               on the network following the success of the "How Will I Know" video.</p>

            <p> She was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first 
                three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential than they
                were in the years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic</p>

        <h4>Whitney's Death</h4>
        <p>On February 11 2012, Houston was found unconscious in Suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton, submerged in the bathtub. Beverly 
           Hills paramedics arrived about 3:30 pm, found Houston unresponsive, and performed CPR. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 pm PST. 
           The cause of death was not immediately known; local police said there were "no obvious signs of criminal intent". On March 22, 2012, 
           the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office reported that Houston's death was caused by drowning and the "effects of atherosclerotic heart 
           disease and cocaine use". The office said the amount of cocaine found in Houston's body indicated that she used the substance shortly
           before her death. </p>
