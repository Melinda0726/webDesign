   <h2>Welcome to My Web page</h2>
   <p>Dogs are a humans best friend. Or should i say family! They will comfort you when you need them and give you the time and attention
    that we all need in our lives. Once you get used to them being around they will be considered family and everyone will treat them
    like no other.</p>

   <p>Whether you like them big or whether you like them small you will instantly fall in love. All they need is love and some time to
    get used too. But when that bond is started and you continue to grow old with that special dog in your life they will always remember
    that home is were the heart is.</p>
